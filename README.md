## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- GitHub URL: [GitHub](https://github.com/carreuky/sunny-side)
- Live Site URL: [Live](https://carreuky.github.io/sunny-side/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was able to practice the use of position absolute for component positioning.Bootstrap for different screen sizes/media views. I learnt the toggle application in HTML and CSS for the mobile navigation toggle. 


### Continued development

I still intend to learn more about sizing images and making the responsive. Guaging the sizes, paddings and font-sizes from the images provided sometimes seems hard so i plan to keep practicing to get pixel perfect. Position absolute perfection with media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Font](https://www.googlefonts.com) - I got fonts to incorparate.
